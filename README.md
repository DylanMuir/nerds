Description
---------
Matlab package implementing blind deconvolution method for neural spike recovery

Requirements
---------
* Matlab >= 2007
* [SPGL1](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mpf/spgl1/) (Solver for large-scale sparse reconstruction)

Usage
---------
To setup SPGL1 package, change directory to the downloaded SPGL1 folder then type following line in Matlab shell.

`spgsetup`

In order to download NERDS folder, either download zip file from git repository directly or use git to clone 
repository to particular directory that we want

`git clone https://github.com/KordingLab/nerds`
